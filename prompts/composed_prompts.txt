# Composed Prompts for Perceptual Variants

## Variant 1 — Erratic Motion
environment: same as baseline
robot: same Jackal model
behavior: jittery acceleration, frequent turns, inconsistent stop–go motion
prompt addition: "simulate uncertainty or malfunction through irregular wheel motion"

## Variant 2 — Massive Form
environment: same as baseline
robot: scaled 1.5x larger, heavy treads, lower camera mount
behavior: slower, deliberate navigation
prompt addition: "convey mechanical weight and industrial form"

## Variant 3 — Signal-Rich
environment: same as baseline
robot: add LED strips, directional lights, blinking indicators
behavior: gestures or light cues during turns
prompt addition: "simulate intent communication via color and light patterns"
